# TypeScript
- Language by Microsoft for ES 6 based application development

- ES 6 Features implemented in TypeScript
    - Scope Definitions using 'let' keyword (say goodbye to 'var')
    - String Interpolation aka Template string aka Immutable String Object definition
    - Arrow Operators
    - Data Types
        - Number, String, Object, Array<T>, Date, any (default), void (used by the method that does not returns anything)
        - enum
        -  Union Types  
            - Declaring a varibale with More than one Datatype
    - Array Class with Various methods    
        - push(), pop(), shift(), unshift(), sort(), reverse(), filter(), forEach(), map(), reduce(), etc.
        - Using Array<T> generic class
            - T can be TypeScript Supported Datatype
    - String class with Various methods
        - substr(), subString(), replace(), search(), etc.
    - Type Definitions
        - Creating the custom datatype definition based on multiple Standard types 
    - rest parameters aka spread operators
        - used to pass multiple variable number of parameters to a method
        - Used by mutating the object by adding new values /  properties in existing object
    - Object Oriented Programming
        - Class
            - Access Specifiers
            - private, public, protected
            - default access specifier for methods is public
        - Generics
        - Interfaces    

# Programming with TypeScript
    - Create a package.json
        - A file that configure the ES based projects (Front0End and Server-Side)
    - The Machine MUST Node.js
        - This will provide the 'npm' utility
        - Create a package.json using following command 
                - npm init
                    - Command line Wizard to create a package.json
                - npm init -y | npm init -f
                    - Create a package.json with defaults
    - Install TypeScript in Global Scope
        - npm install -g typescript                
            - This will provide the 'tsc' utility
            - This utility will be used to transpile TypeScript into JavaScript
                - tsc [Source-TypeScript].ts  
        - If the TypeScript transpilation is failing then do not forcefully use the transpiled JavaScript for production
            - This may result into App Crash or Memory-Leaks         

# Angular Programming
- Using Angular CLI
    - Ready Project to create an Angular Application
    - @angular/cli
        - npm install @angular/cli
    - This will provide 'ng' utility
        - Utility for Managing Angular Application as follows
            - Create Angular Applcation
                - ng new [NAME-OF-THE-APP]
                - e.g. ng new my-ng-app
            - ng serve
                - Build the Project and Host it on default Node Server on default port as 4200
            - ng build
                - Dev. Build
                - ng build --prod
                    - Production Build
            - ng test
                - Run Angular test
# Angular Folder Structure
- package.json
    - "@angular/animations"
        - Animation
    - "@angular/common"
        - Loading of Angular Modules
    - "@angular/compiler"
        - Validate and Compile Angular Object Model
    - "@angular/core"
        - Most of Standard Angular Objects are here
        - NgModule
            - A Decorator applied on TypeScript class to define it as Angular Module
            - Angular Module is a Container for Component, Directives, Services, Pipes and other Custom Classes
            - Properties
                - imports: Of the Type Array, that imports various Standard Modules and External Modules to run the current NG Application
                - declarations:  Of the Type Array, used to declare all component , directive of the current Module so that they are instantiated when the current module is loaded
                - providers:  Of the Type Array, used to provide a dependency container to register all Angular Services in current NG Module
                - bootstrap:  Of the Type Array, used to define which components from 'declarations' will be loaded and rendered in browser using BrowserModule 
        - Component
            - A Decorator applied on TypeScript class to define it as Angular Component
            - Properties
                - selector: The CUSTOM-HTML-TAG that will be used to refer the component for rendering
                - template: The inline HTML DOM aka UI for the Component
                - templateUrl: External html file that contains the UI
                - styles: Inline CSS Styles
                - styleUrls: Array of External CSS files used by the component
            - When the App is rendered, to Execute the component follow steps as
                - Make sure that the Component is declared in NgModule in its 'declarations' array      
                - Make sure that the component  is added in 'bootstrap' array of NgModule
                - Make sure that the 'selector' value of the component is used as Custom HTML element in index.html  
        - Directive
            - A Decorator applied on TypeScript class to define it as Angular Directive
        - Pipe
            - A Decorator applied on TypeScript class to define it as Angular Custom Pipe
        - Injectable
            - A Decorator applied on TypeScript class to define it as Angular Service for creating Reusable Utilities e.g. Http Calls
        - Input
            - A Decorator applied on Property of a TypeScript class to define it as property that will accept input from Parent-Component 
        - Output
            - A Decorator applied on the EventEmitter<T> class  to define and event to emit data from Child Component to Parent Component
                - EventEmitter<T>: Is a part of @angular/core
        - HostListener
            - A Decorator applied on method of the TypeScript class to indicate that the method will be executed when a specific event is raised        
            - This will be used in Component and Directive creation 
        - Renderer2
            - Manage a custom rendering of HTML DOM based on Event 
            - Used in Creation of Custom Directive
        - Elementref
            - Class used to refer a HTML DOM on which the Directive is applied
            - USed in case of Custom Directives    

    - "@angular/forms"
        - Used for Working with Angular Data-Driven-Forms
            - Pure MVC in Angular
        - FormGroup
            - Group of FormControls as a FormControlCollection
        - FormBuilder
            - Builds a FormGroup 
        - FormControl
            - Each Editable element in HTML Form    
    - "@angular/platform-browser"
        - Rendering of the Angular Application 
        - BrowserModule    
    - "@angular/platform-browser-dynamic"
        - Bootstrap the Angular Application
        - platformBrowserDynamic.bootstrapModule(ANGULAR-MODULE)
    - "@angular/router" 
        - USed for Single Page Application
        - RouterModule
            - Represents Route Table, Route Navigation as well as The ROute Container

- Running the Angular Application
    - ng serve
- Angular Build Files
vendor.js             | vendor        |   2.00 MB |-->The Standard Angular packages build into single file

- Angular Databinding
    - String interpolation or Templates or Expression-Binding
        - Binding public property of the Component to HTML UI
            - e.g. Consider 'name:string' is a public proeprty
            - {{name}}
            - Read-only binding, means not changed from UI 
    - Property Binding
        - Binding public property of the Component to Attribute of HTML element
            - NOTE: Angular have design new HTML parser that parse and executed HTML attributes
                - e.g., value, hidden, readonly, disabled, checked, etc.
            - Syntax
                - [ATTRIBUTE-OF-HTML-ELEMENT]="PUBLIC-PROPERTY"
            - e.g.
                - <input type="text" [value]="name">
                - The 'name' cane not be changed from UI, One-Way from Component to UI  
    - Event-Binding
        - Bind a public method of the Component to UI Event
        - UI-to-Component
        - Syntax
            - (EVENT)="method()" 
            - <button (click)="f1()"></click>
                - f1() is a public method from the component
    - Two-Way Binding
        - Combinition of Property Binding + Event Binding  
        - The property is bound to Editable UI element, it can updated from UI to Component and component back to UI
        - [(ngModel)]="PUBLIC-PROPERTY-FROM-COMPONENT"
            - IMP**: To use 'ngModel', the 'FormModule' from @angular/forms Must be imported in the 'imports' array of the NgModule
